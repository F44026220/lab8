Q1:
Before line 6, an "empty throw" occurs.
However, "empty throw" is only allowed in "catch block" as the resulf of no exception currently processed.
Therefore, the program terminates.

Q2:
After compilation and executing the file, we got a message:

	terminate called after throwing an instance of 'double'
	Aborted

This indicates that the number "3.0" in line 6 is in the type of "double".
However, the type that "catch" is waiting for is "float", resulting in a failure to catch the exception.
Therefore, no exception handler can process the exception, leading to termination of the program without printing out the string.

Q3:
Modify the codes in "tetris.cpp":

  	try {
     	    mino_ptr = genMino();
           } catch (bad_alloc & Badalloc) {
          	cout<<Badalloc.what()<<endl;
          	cout<<"codes work!"<<endl;
          	exit(1);
               }

After numerous loops(also, the codes around "new" have been modified to allocate array), we got a message:

	std::bad_alloc
	codes work!
